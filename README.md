# anomaly_detection

Anomaly Detection is an application of Deep Learning and Computer vision. It is designed to classify anomalous videos based on realistic anomalies. Our goal is to extract the relevant information from the real-world videos in order to produce numerical or symbolic form to classify them in the respective output. In this application, we have 13 different classification labels based on which the model will predict the presence or absence of anomaly.
